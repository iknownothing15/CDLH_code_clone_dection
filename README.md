# CDLH code clone dection

## Description

We wish to implement CDLH-based code clone detection, although the code being uploaded is not yet.

CDLH is a AST-based clone dection AI model, look [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3172077.3172312) to learn more.

## Notice

+ I created this repo in a hurry, so it looks very rudimentary and missing a lot of things right now!
+ We used OJ Clone data set.
+ This is only semi finished code, we will update soon.
+ `temp/data_pairs.pkl` and `temp/data_pairs.pkl` is now anandoned, we will soon remove code that generates it.
